single-c
========
simplified test-suite using single C file for each test


Tree layout of this directory
-----------------------------
./CMakeLists.txt            CMake configuration file for this test-suite
./sync.sh                   script for syncing of expected results (dangerous)
./*/                        directories with test groups
./*/*/                      directories with individual tests
./*/*/*.c                   C file given as input to the tools (1 for each test)
./*/*/output-exp@${tool}    expected csgrep output for tool ${tool}

./**/output-convert.sh@${tool}
                            script that converts output of ${tool} for csgrep

./**/args-prefix@${tool}    arguments prefix given to tool ${tool}
./**/args-suffix@${tool}    arguments suffix given to tool ${tool}
./**/test-props@${tool}     test properties for [exec], for example TIMEOUT

NOTE: File starting with ./**/ can be currently specified, either for individual
      tests or for a group of tests.  In future, this may be extended also for
      files shared by the whole test-suite (placed directly in this directory).


Tree layout of the corresponding working directory: ${WORKDIR}/single-c
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
./Makefile                  generated Makefile for the single-c test-suite
./${group}/${test}/${tool}/ working directories for test/tool combinations,
each of them contains:
    .../*.c                 symlink to C file used as input (1 for each test)
    .../cmd-tool.sh         generated shell script used to run the tool
    .../cmd-convert.sh      symlink to output format converter
    .../output-raw.txt      raw output captured from execution of cmd-tool.sh
    .../output-con.txt      output converted by cmd-convert.sh
    .../output-uni.txt      output further converted by csgrep
    .../output-exp.txt      symlink to expected output for the test/tool pair
