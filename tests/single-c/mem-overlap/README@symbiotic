# Symbiotic

Currently no tests in this category are run for symbiotic.

Tests of correct behaviour silently fail in Symbiotic, because of pointer
comparison in the `assert`s. Reported as
[issue #136](https://github.com/staticafi/symbiotic/issues/136).

Tests of incorrect behaviour fail because Symbiotic lacks any mechanisms for
detection of memory overlapping. TODO: This should be reported after the issue
above is resolved.
