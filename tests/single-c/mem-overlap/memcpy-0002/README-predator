This bug is missed by Predator because gcc's unconditional over-optimization
removes the call to memcpy() and Predator gets the following intermediate code:

int ()(void):0]main():
                goto L1

        L1:
                [void *:8]%rF9192773993871441920 := ([int []*:8]&%mF2089:arr [ptr]+ 1U)
                [unsigned int:2]%rF2092 := [unsigned int:2]*%rF9192773993871441920
                [unsigned int:2]%mF2089:arr := [unsigned int:2]%rF2092
                CLOBBER [int []:5]%mF2089:arr
                [int:4]%rF2091 := 0
                goto L2

        L2:
                ret [int:4]%rF2091
