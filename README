aufover-benchmark
=================
A unified set of automated tests for multiple formal verification tools
(cbmc, symbiotic, divine) as well as static analysis tools (gcc, clang,
cppcheck).


How to run existing tests?
--------------------------
- enable yum/dnf repositories from the following coprs:
    https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/lzaoral/Divine/
    https://copr.devel.redhat.com/coprs/acalabek/symbiotic/
    https://copr.devel.redhat.com/coprs/vmihalko/cbmc_utils/

- install required/optional dependencies of the benchmark on the system:
    $ make install-deps

- configure the benchmark:
    $ make

- run the tests:
    $ make check

- look for Label Time Summary in the output, it will tell you:
    - which tools actually ran
    - how many tests each of them analyzed (you need to divide the numbers by 4)
    - how much time it took for each of the tools
