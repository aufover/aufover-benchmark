aufover-benchmark
=================
A unified set of automated tests for multiple formal verification tools
(cbmc, symbiotic, divine) as well as static analysis tools (gcc, clang,
cppcheck).


How to run existing tests?
--------------------------
- enable yum/dnf repositories from the following coprs:
    https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/lzaoral/Divine/
    https://copr.devel.redhat.com/coprs/acalabek/symbiotic/
    https://copr.devel.redhat.com/coprs/vmihalko/cbmc_utils/

- install required/optional dependencies of the benchmark on the system:
    $ make install-deps

- configure the benchmark:
    $ make

- run the tests:
    $ make check

- look for Label Time Summary in the output, it will tell you:
    - which tools actually ran
    - how many tests each of them analyzed (you need to divide the numbers by 4)
    - how much time it took for each of the tools


Alternative ways of running tests
---------------------------------
- passing custom options to ctest:
    $ CTEST_OPTS='-LE divine' make check

- using a custom working directory:
    $ mkdir /tmp/my-custom-wd
    $ WORKDIR=/tmp/my-custom-wd make check [-C PATH_TO_THIS_REPO]

- using source directory as a working directory:
    $ cd tests
    $ cmake .
    $ ctest -j16 --progress         # see doc/cmake.txt for other useful options

- running tests for selected tool (expected to be run from a working directory):
    $ ctest --print-labels
    $ ctest -L cbmc
    $ ctest -LE divine

- running selected tests (expected to be run from a working directory):
    $ ctest --show-only
    $ ctest -R test-0006
    $ ctest -E predator-regre
